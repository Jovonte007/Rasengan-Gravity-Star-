üìò README ‚Äì Project Gravity Star Blueprint

üß† Overview

Project Gravity Star is a visionary concept for a next-generation rotational field engine‚Äîfusing principles of superconductivity, magnetism, field compression, and photonic resonance into a unified propulsion and energy system.

This document contains the foundational theory, component breakdowns, and mechanism of action for the Gravity Star‚Äîa vortex-based, self-regulating system that bends space through harmonic resonance.

üîç What‚Äôs Inside

Core Components
A list of specialized materials and phenomena used to stabilize, amplify, and regulate the system (e.g., vanadium dioxide, quartz, topological superconductors, and photoluminescence dynamics).

System Mechanics
Step-by-step explanation of how energy flows, magnetic fields spin, eddy currents form, and how the toroidal structure amplifies these interactions.

Field Dynamics
Insights into how the Gravity Star mimics stellar phenomena, including self-compression, harmonic fusion, and photonic vortices.

Applications & Future Potential
Conceptual uses in propulsion, energy generation, and containment systems. A vision for incorporating the Gravity Star into broader innovation frameworks like the Seven Pillars Blueprint or Ghost Pulse Drives.
